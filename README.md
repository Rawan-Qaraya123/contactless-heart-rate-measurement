# contactless-heart-rate-measurement
This project develops contactless heart rate measurement. Two methods were evaluated: facial color change analysis (95.45% accuracy, 4.55% error) and frequency analysis (86.88% accuracy, 13.68% error). Results suggest contactless measurement as a potential alternative for medical use.
